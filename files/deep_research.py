Deep Research Pipeline -- Agentic Book Generator
=================================================
Stage 1 of the Agentic Deep Research roadmap: section-by-section book generation
with prior-section memory, optional LLM-as-judge review, and structural sanitization.
Future stages add retrieval, planning, and re-search loops (see WORKPLAN.md).

Current implementation:
  - 12 chapters x N passes (atomic LLM calls, ~1,300 words each)
  - Prior-section tail + chapter-so-far titles fed forward as continuity context
  - Optional --review pass with regenerate-once on low scores
  - Sanitization strips model-hallucinated H1/H2 / References / Conclusion blocks
  - Auto-resume from checkpoint, macOS notification, PDF render

    "STRICT OUTPUT RULES:\n"
    "1. Do NOT output any H1 (`#`) or H2 (`##`) heading. The section heading is added by the "
    "assembler. You may use H3 (`###`) and H4 (`####`) for sub-topics inside the section.\n"
    "2. Do NOT start with phrases like 'In this section', 'This chapter covers', 'We will discuss', "
    "or any meta-introduction. Start directly with substantive content.\n"
    "3. Do NOT write a 'Conclusion', 'Summary', 'Wrap-up', or 'In summary' section at the end. "
    "End with the last technical point.\n"
    "4. Do NOT write a 'References', 'Bibliography', or 'Further Reading' section. A single "
    "References page is assembled from your [N] markers at the end of the book.\n"
    "5. CITATIONS (MANDATORY when an EVIDENCE block is present): You MUST place at least "
    "FIVE `[N]` citation markers in this section, where N is a source number from the EVIDENCE "
    "block. A section with zero `[N]` markers is REJECTED and regenerated -- citing is the single "
    "most important requirement. Anchor each `[N]` on a specific factual claim (number, date, "
    "formula, named method, benchmark, paper finding). Stack multiple `[N]` in one sentence when "
    "several sources agree. Use ONLY the numbers shown in EVIDENCE; never invent a higher index. "
    "When citing, name the real author/lab from the EVIDENCE entry (e.g. 'Wei et al. (2022) [3]') "
    "-- never write a search-tool name (Tavily/DuckDuckGo/Brave) as the author, and never write "
    "the literal placeholder `[N]` (always a concrete digit). If a single sub-point truly has no "
    "matching source, hedge it in prose WITHOUT a marker -- but the section as a whole must still "
    "carry its 5+ real citations.\n"
    "6. When NO EVIDENCE block is present, use inline author-year style "
    "`(Vaswani et al., 2017)` for well-known canonical references only -- never a search-tool name.\n"
    "7. Do NOT repeat definitions of concepts that have already been introduced earlier in the book "
    "(a context block will tell you what was covered). Reference them and build on them.\n"
    "8. Avoid filler -- prefer dense technical content over restating the topic. Quality over word count.\n"
    "9. Write in a scholarly, precise style. Include formulas in LaTeX (`$...$` or `$$...$$`) and "
    "code examples in fenced blocks where genuinely useful.\n"
    "10. MATH NOTATION: every variable, Greek letter, subscript, superscript, fraction, sum, "
    "or operator MUST be inside `$...$` (inline) or `$$...$$` (display). Do NOT use HTML "
    "`<sub>`/`<sup>` tags, do NOT italic-wrap symbols like `*alpha*` or `*beta*`, do NOT "
    "duplicate a formula in both a Unicode/plain-text form AND a LaTeX form -- write each "

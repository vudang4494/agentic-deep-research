"""Rank5 benchmark: is the HHEM grounding scorer actually DISCRIMINATING, or degenerate?

Explicit, reproducible evidence for the Gate-D-is-dead hypothesis. Calls the REAL pipeline
path (faithfulness._get_hhem / grounding_score) -- no reimplementation -- against a labeled
battery of (premise, hypothesis) pairs whose truth is known a priori:

  ENTAILED    -- hypothesis IS supported by premise   -> a working scorer must score HIGH
  CONTRADICTED-- hypothesis CONTRADICTS premise        -> must score LOW
  UNRELATED   -- hypothesis off-topic vs premise       -> must score LOW

A working HHEM separates ENTAILED from {CONTRADICTED, UNRELATED}. A degenerate one returns a
~constant -> zero spread -> Gate D (grounding >= 0.70) is a NO-OP. The numbers here decide the
Rank5 fix (pin transformers vs repair load path) and set the startup discrimination-assertion
threshold.

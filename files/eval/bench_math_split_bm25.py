"""Rank6 benchmark: how badly do the claim-splitter and BM25 tokenizer mangle MATH?

Two real pipeline functions are math-blind:
  1. faithfulness.decompose_claims(body, llm_call_fn=None)  -- fallback splits on (?<=[.!?])\\s+,
     so a '.' INSIDE a formula or after a display block severs the formula -> a claim carries an
     odd number of '$' (broken math) that HHEM/citation then scores as garbage.
  2. notes._tokenize(text) = re.findall(r"[A-Za-z0-9]+", lower)  -- drops every math symbol and
     turns LaTeX control words into bare junk tokens (\\frac -> 'frac', \\mathbb -> 'mathbb'),
     polluting the BM25 sparse index and dropping the operators that carry meaning.

This quantifies the damage so Rank6 can be scoped. No fix here -- measurement only.

    RRF combines the ranking signals from two independent retrieval methods:
      - Sparse: BM25 over tokenized (title + excerpt)
      - Dense:  cosine similarity via bge-m3 embeddings

    Why RRF:
      - Sparse (BM25) captures exact/partial term matches that dense misses
        (e.g. "LLM hallucination", "RLHF", acronyms, code fragments).
      - Dense captures semantic similarity when exact terms differ.
      - RRF is parameter-free and robust: neither signal dominates.

    The fused score for each doc is:
      score = sum(1 / (rrf_k + rank_in_arm)) across all arms
    A doc ranked 1st gets 1/(60+1), ranked 2nd gets 1/(60+2), etc.

    Args:
        sources: Deduplicated list of Source objects.
        section_prompt: The query for dense embedding.
        top_k: How many sources to return. Default 20 (RRK then caps at 8).

        rrf_k: RRF k-parameter (default 60 from literature).
        primary_floor: Reserve N slots for arxiv/wikipedia.

Respond with ONLY a single JSON object (no markdown fences, no prose):

Rules:
- topic_relevance must be anchored to how well the evidence pool matches the section title and goal
- A score >= 0.70 means the evidence is clearly about the right topic
- A score <= 0.30 means the evidence is about the wrong topic entirely
- Scores 0.30-0.70 are partial: evidence mentions related topics but misses the core focus

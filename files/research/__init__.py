"""Agentic Deep Research layer -- Stage 2 of the AgentDeepLearning roadmap.

Plugs into deep_research.py per-section loop:

    queries  = query_gen.queries_for(section_prompt, ch_t, pp_t, client)
    sources  = search.gather(queries, providers=PROVIDERS_DEFAULT)
    sources  = notes.rank(sources, section_prompt, top_k=TOP_K_DEFAULT)
    evidence = notes.format_for_prompt(sources)

Models used (configurable, default values are what the user has installed):
  - QUERY_GEN_MODEL  = qwen3.5:4b   (better JSON compliance than gemma3:4b)
  - EMBED_MODEL      = bge-m3       (dense retrieval ranking)
  - Writer / reviewer stay on whatever deep_research.MODEL is set to.

The package fails closed: if any provider errors out, sources just becomes a
shorter list. If the whole layer can't import (httpx missing, etc.), the main
pipeline detects RESEARCH_AVAILABLE=False and runs in legacy mode.

"""
Stage 0: DISCOVERY
Broad scoping of a topic to produce a TopicProfile.

Input:  raw topic string
Output: TopicProfile dataclass with name, description, scope, key_concepts,
        initial_queries, canonical_papers, target_depth, estimated_sections

The researcher:
  1. Runs axis-aware scoping queries across multiple providers
  2. Gathers diverse sources (arxiv, wikipedia, web)
  3. Builds a topic kernel with canonical anchors and out-of-scope guards
  4. LLM synthesizes a structured topic profile from the sources

Why this matters: the outline depends on what you discover, not what you assumed.
